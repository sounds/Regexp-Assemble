Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Assemble.

0.06 Fri Dec 17 17:38:41 2004 UTC
    - Can now track regular expressions. Given a match, it is
      possible to determine which original pattern gave rise to the
      match.
    - Improved character class generation: . (anychar) was not
      special-cased, which would have lead to a.b axb giving a[.x]b
      Also takes into account single-char width metachars like \t
      \e et al. Filters out digits if \d appears, and for similar
      metachars (\D, \s, \W...)
    - Added a pre_filter method, to perform input filtering prior
      to the pattern being lexed.
    - Added a flags method, to allow for (?imsx) pattern modifiers.
    - enhanced the assemble script: added -b, -c, -d, -v;
      documented -r
    - Additions to the README
    - Added Test::Simple and Test::More as prerequisites.

    - Bug fix in tests. The skip test in version 0.04 did not deal
      correctly with non-5.6.0 perls that do not have Test::Deep
      installed.

	- In 5.6.0, the backlashes in a quoted word list, qw[ \\d ],
	  will have their backslashes doubled up. In this case, don't
	  run the tests. (Reading from a file or getting input from
	  some other source other than qw[] operators works just fine).

    - Bug fix: Leading 0s could be omitted from paths because of the
      difference between while($p) versus while(defined($p)).
    - An assembled pattern can be generated with whitespace. This can be
      used in conjunction with the /x modifier, and also for debugging.
    - Code profiled: dead code paths removed, hotspots rewritten to run
      more quickly.
    - Documentation typos and wordos.
    - assemble script now accepts a number of command line switches to
      control its behaviour.
    - More tests. Now with Test::Pod.

    - An R::A object that has had nothing added to it now produces a
      pattern that explicitly matches nothing (the original behaviour would
      match anything).
    - An object can now chomp its own input. Useful for slurping files. It
      can also filter the input tokens and discard patterns that don't adhere
      to what's expected (sanity checking e.g.: don't want spaces).
    - Documented and added functions to allow for the lexer pattern to be
      manipulated.
    - The reset() method was commented out (and the test suite didn't catch
      the fact).
    - Detabbed the Assemble.pm, eg/* and t/* files (I like interpreting
      tabs as four spaces, but this produces horrible indentation on
      www.cpan.org).
    - t/00_basic.t test counts were wrong. This showed up if Test::Deep was
      not installed.
    - t/02_reduce.t does not need to 'use Data::Dumper'.
    - Tweaked eg/hostmatch/hostmatch; added eg/assemble, eg/assemble-check
    - Typos, corrections and addtions to the documentation.
