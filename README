The file is the README for Regexp::Assemble version 0.01

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

TESTING

This module requires the following modules for thorough testing:

	Test::More
	Test::Deep
	Test::File::Contents

I suspect I could rewrite the tests with out Test::Deep these days;
Test::More should be sufficient. This is mainly the result of legacy
architectural decisions that no longer hold true.

BASIC USAGE

use Regexp::Assemble;

my $ra = Regexp::Assemble->new;
$ra->add( 'ab+c' );
$ra->add( 'ab+\\d*\\s+c' );
$ra->add( 'a\\w+\\d+' );
$ra->add( 'a\\d+' );
print $ra->re; # prints (?:a(?:b+(?:\d*\s+)?c|(?:\w+)?\d+))

or

my $ra = Regexp::Assemble->new
	->add( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'foom' );

print "$_ matches\n" if /$ra/
	for (qw/word more stuff food rabble bark/);

or

use Regexp::Assemble;
my @word = qw/flip flop slip slop/;

print Regexp::Assemble->new->add(@word)->as_string;
    # produces [fs]l[io]p

print Regexp::Assemble->new->add(@word)->reduce(0)->as_string;
    # produces (?:fl(?:ip|op)|sl(?:ip|op))

See the ./eg directory for some example scripts. More will be added
in subsequent releases.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

I'll fill this bit out when in a later release. If you are curious,
you can dump out the internal data struct with the following:

  use Data::Dumper;
  $Data::Dumper::Terse     = 0;
  $Data::Dumper::Indent    = 0;
  $Data::Dumper::Quotekeys = 0;
  $Data::Dumper::Pair      = '=>';

  print Dumper($r->_path);

A more compact representation can also be obtained with

  print Regexp::Assemble::_dump($r->_path);

STATUS

This module is under active development.

I do appreciate getting e-mail, especially about Perl. Please keep in
mind that I get a lot of spam, and take drastic measures to reduce the
flow. One of the measures involves a gigantic regular expression that
contains many thousands of patterns that match hostnames of dynamic
dialup/residential/home IP addresses. That pattern is of course built
with this module.

It would be ironic if I rejected your mail coming from such an address.
Please use your ISPs outbound MX, or pay what it takes to get your
reverse DNS changed to something else.
